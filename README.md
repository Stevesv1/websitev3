# Poly Whales Tracker 🐋

A production-ready real-time monitoring dashboard for tracking high-performance whale traders on Polymarket with complete market context and continuous monitoring.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Whale Alerts**: Instant notifications when elite whale traders place bets
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated monitoring system that runs 24/7 like polymarketv1
- **Smart Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents exact duplicate trades while allowing multiple bets from same trader
- **Market Context**: See full market titles and outcomes for each bet
- **Historical Performance**: Comprehensive trader stats including PNL, position value, and trade history
- **Latest Bets Tracking**: Detailed view of the most recent bets with size, price, and value
- **Smart Filtering**: Customizable thresholds for trades, PNL, wins, and bet values
- **Live Updates**: Real-time Supabase subscriptions for instant alert delivery
- **Mobile-First Design**: Fully responsive interface optimized for all devices

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite 5
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS 3 + shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time + Edge Functions)
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Monitoring**: Continuous polling with VPS script

## 📦 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Deploy Edge Function

```bash
supabase functions deploy polymarket-monitor
```

### 4. Start Continuous Monitoring

#### Option A: Using VPS (Recommended for Production)

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x vps-monitor.sh

# Start in a screen session
screen -S polymarket
./vps-monitor.sh

# Detach: Ctrl+A then D
# Reattach: screen -r polymarket
```

#### Option B: Manual Testing

```bash
curl -X POST https://ikogbedmigsgcgheusrd.supabase.co/functions/v1/polymarket-monitor \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"preventDuplicates": false, "processAllTrades": true}'
```

## 🎛️ Configuration

### Monitoring Behavior

The system tracks each unique trade using blockchain transaction hashes stored in the database:

✅ **Allowed**: Same trader placing multiple bets (different transactions)
✅ **Allowed**: All legitimate trades are tracked
❌ **Prevented**: Processing the same blockchain transaction twice (persists across function calls)

**How it works:**
- Each trade has a unique `transactionHash` from the blockchain
- Transaction hashes are stored in `processed_trades` table in Supabase
- This persists across edge function calls (unlike in-memory storage)
- Same trader can place multiple bets and all will be tracked
- Only prevents reprocessing the exact same blockchain transaction
- Old processed trades (>7 days) are automatically cleaned up

### Monitoring Modes

Edit `vps-monitor.sh` line 71 to change mode:

**Mode 1: Continuous (Default)**
```json
{"preventDuplicates": false, "processAllTrades": true}
```
- Alerts on every qualifying bet
- Prevents only exact duplicates
- Best for production

**Mode 2: Deduplicated**
```json
{"preventDuplicates": true, "processAllTrades": true}
```
- One alert per trader per 5 minutes
- Reduces notification noise
- Best for testing

### Custom Thresholds

```json
{
  "thresholds": {
    "minTrades": 100,
    "minRealizedPnl": 10000,
    "minLargestWin": 1000,
    "minPositionValue": 10000,
    "minBetValue": 500
  }
}
```

## 📊 How It Works

1. **VPS Script** calls edge function every 10 seconds
2. **Edge Function**:
   - Fetches last 100 trades from Polymarket API
   - Uses blockchain `transactionHash` to identify unique trades
   - Checks `processed_trades` table to skip already-processed transactions
   - Stores new transaction hashes in database
   - Checks trader stats against thresholds
   - Creates alerts in database for qualifying trades
3. **Frontend** receives real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
4. **Users** can filter and view alerts with custom thresholds

**Key Insight:** Each blockchain transaction has a unique hash. By storing processed transaction hashes in the database (not just in memory), we ensure:
- Every legitimate trade is captured
- No duplicate alerts even across multiple edge function calls
- Persistence across server restarts
- Automatic cleanup of old data (>7 days)

## 🔍 Understanding the Output

### VPS Monitor Output

```
[2025-01-26 10:30:45] ✅ Processed 45/100 trades → 3 NEW ALERTS!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚨 HIGH-PERFORMANCE BETTOR DETECTED!

📊 Trader Historical Stats:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### No Alerts Appearing

1. Check if monitoring is running: `screen -ls`
2. Lower thresholds in the edge function call
3. Check edge function logs: `supabase functions logs polymarket-monitor`

### Too Many Alerts

1. Enable duplicate prevention: `"preventDuplicates": true`
2. Increase thresholds
3. Increase check interval in `vps-monitor.sh`

### Website Not Showing Alerts

1. Check database: Alerts should be in `bet_alerts` table
2. Check frontend filters
3. Check browser console for errors
